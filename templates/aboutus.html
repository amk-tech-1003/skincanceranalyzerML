                            Skin Cancer is an uncontrollable growth of 
abnormal cells in the epidermis which is the outer layer 
of the skin. It is caused when the DNA is altered and it 
can't properly control skin cell growth. Skin cancer is also 
one of the most hazardous forms of cancer. <br><br>
There are 4 main types of skin cancer named as Basal 
cell carcinoma, Basal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell cancer, 
and Melanoma. Detection of Skin cancer in the early stage 
will be helpful to cure it. The normal dermatologist way 
to diagnose skin cancer is visual, with the dermoscopic 
assessment of the lesion followed by biopsy and 
histopathologic evaluation which is very long which leads 
the patient to critical stages of cancer. Currently, many 
technologies have been developed to increase the accuracy 
of detecting skin cancer as early as possible.<br><br>
Computer Vision can play a vital role in medical 
Image diagnosis which has been proved by the existing 
systems. In this article, we are analysing all the seven 
types of skin cancers, they are Melanoma (MEL), 
Melanomic Neves (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), 
Actinic Keratosis (AKIEC), Benign Keratosis (BKL),

                            Dermatofibroma (DF), Vascular Lesion (VASC) to get the
better understanding of how to build the CNN 
(Convolutional Neural Network) model which will 
perform image processing on various image dataset of 
skin cancer to analyze and detect its type.<br><br>
Upon understanding Dr. Sharmila Gaikwadâ€™s "Study on 
Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare." and getting 
motivated by it we understood the importance to curb this 
global incidence of skin cancer from reaching massive 
heights. There is an urgent need of reliable and accurate 
systems to not only help the expert dermatologists in the 
field but also individuals to detect skin lesion types as 
early as possible.<br><br>
Skin Analyzer will help 
dermatologists for early detection of cancer in skin 
and give them more time to perfect their future steps 
in curing the patients, because time plays an 
extremely important role in providing cure for this 
deadly disease.
